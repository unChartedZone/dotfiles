# My Dotfiles for Linux!  These are the config files that I have made in a 
# Manjaro Distro environment.
Note: These files have only been tested on Manjaro Linux. 

## Zsh 
I use zsh as my main shell. To set up, use the command `chsh -s
/bin/zsh` to make zsh your default shell. If you would like to revert to your
previous shell just run the previous command again but replace `/bin/zsh` with
the shell of your choice. Then run the command `ln -s
dotfiles/zsh/zshrc.symlink ~/.zshrc` to make a soft link.

## Vim & Neovim I use both Vim and Neovim depending on my needs. Vim has
plugins that make it a great light editor for almost any language, and Neovim
on the other hand tweaked specifically for C/C++ and Javascript with the
YouCompleteMe plugin.

## Emacs I have slightly dabbled with emacs. It is not my main editor of
choice. It is still a work in progress but I do plan on adding to it
eventually.
