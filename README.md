# My Dotfiles

These are the config files for zsh,tmux, hyperterm, intellij, clion, ctags, and everything
else I need to be productive on my computer.

## Zsh
I use zsh as my main shell. To set up, use the command `chsh -s /bin/zsh` to make zsh your default shell. Then run the commnand `ln -s dotfiles/zsh/zshrc.symlink ~/.zshrc` to make a soft link.

## Vim & Neovim
I use both Vim and Neovim depending on my needs. Vim for any kind of language, and Neovim tweaked specifically for C/C++ and Javascript.
